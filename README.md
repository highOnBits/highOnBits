### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="35"> About Me :
- 💻 MS in Computer Science student at Oregon State University. 

- 👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience – I’ve seen it all, from front-end frenzies to back-end black holes.

- 🛠️ Expert in React, .NET, MS SQL, and AWS – basically, if it’s tech, I’ve probably tinkered with it.

- 📚 Currently moonlighting as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, helping students decode the mysteries of software engineering and the industry’s sacred scrolls.

- 🔍 Once tried to save the world (or at least some electricity bills) during my work as a Graduate Research Asssistant by turning waste heat into electricity. Yeah, I dabble in energy alchemy.

- ⚡ When I'm not coding, you can find me cracking LeetCode problems or turning blank canvases into abstract masterpieces.
